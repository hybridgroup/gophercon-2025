### Skynet LLM robotic interface

Get ready to give some intelligence to the machines with Skynet! Skynet is a lightweight command line interface for LLMs to control real robots and drones using Bash from your own machine.

You can currently use Skynet to control either the MiP or the Minidrone using Go.

Start the robot takeover at https://github.com/hybridgroup/skynet.

### Parrot Minidrone

We have Parrot Minidrones you can fly with Go code to control them using their built-in Bluetooth API.

Ready for takeoff? Go to [https://github.com/hybridgroup/tinygo-minidrone](https://github.com/hybridgroup/tinygo-minidrone).

### WowWee MiP robot

![WowWee MiP](./images/mip.png)

Along for the ride, we brought a couple of WowWee MiP two-wheeled self-balancing robots that you control using Bluetooth.

Ready to roll? Go to https://github.com/hybridgroup/tinygo-mip.

### Sphero Mini robot

![Sphero Mini](./images/sphero-mini.png)

You need more robots? Of course you do! We brought a few Sphero Mini ball-shaped robots that you control using Bluetooth.

Keep on rolling at https://github.com/hybridgroup/tinygo-sphero.

### TinyGo IoT sensor

![Arduino Nano RP2040](./sensor/arduino/assets/step6.jpg)

Looking for the true "parts experience"? Got you covered! We have brought some Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect IoT microcontroller boards for each person to use for the activity.

https://store.arduino.cc/collections/boards/products/arduino-nano-rp2040-connect

These can be programmed using TinyGo.

There are some Grove sensor kits that you can use for the activity.

Ready to try this out? Go to [./sensor/arduino/](./sensor/arduino/) to get started.

### TinyGo Bluetooth sensor

[![Go Bluetooth](./images/gobluetooth.png)](https://tinygo.org/bluetooth)

This series of tutorials is intended to help you learn about programming Bluetooth devices using TinyGo and the TinyGo Bluetooth package. Using a Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect IoT microcontroller board and tiny display, discover the Bluetooth devices all around us, and make one of your own.

Ready to Go wireless? Click on [./bluetooth/arduino/](./bluetooth/arduino/) to get started.
