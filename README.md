Looking for the true "parts experience"? Got you covered! We have brought some Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect IoT microcontroller boards for each person to use for the activity.

https://store.arduino.cc/collections/boards/products/arduino-nano-rp2040-connect

These can be programmed using TinyGo.

There are some Grove sensor kits that you can use for the activity.

Ready to try this out? Go to [./sensor/arduino/](./sensor/arduino/) to get started.

### TinyGo Bluetooth Sensor
